Hi, I’m Abhishek Arnav, a sophomore at IIT Delhi, majoring in Material Science and Engineering. 
I have a strong interest in programming, machine learning, and data science, with a focus on their applications in robotics and automation. 
I’m currently working on developing a differential drive system using Sabertooth motor drivers and Kangaroo controllers for ABU Robocon 2025.
